The 116cc engine was scrapped for a bigger 405cc unit and the problem was solved. Harley-Davidson motorcycles are known for their high torque values that are available in everyday riding rev range. Within just one decade, they moved above 1000cc engine capacity and surprised everyone with power that was never experienced before at that time. In 2018, the range of Harley motorcycles in India falls between INR 5.17 to INR 49.99 lakh. "
https://autos.maxabout.com/bikes/hero-motocorp,Hero Bikes,https://ic1.maxabout.us/autos/tw_india/company-logos//H/2017/6/hero-bikes-autos-maxabout.jpg/,Hero,47," Formerly known by the name Hero Honda, Hero MotoCorp is India’s largest selling motorcycle brand. Not just that, their production and sales number makes them world’s number one brand. Hero is still not offering high displacement motorcycles and that makes them more conscious about volume driven market of India and other important markets. Unlike Bajaj Auto with huge export numbers, their prime focus stays on India. The market share of Hero is huge and they ended their 2.5 decade old partnership with Honda in 2010. They basically manufactured lightweight motorcycles that demand less maintenance while offering high fuel economy. HMSI began their operations on full swing afterwards and now, they are chasing Hero to win the first place in Indian motorcycle sales. Hero MotoCorp is known for its tried and tested products that buyers blindly trust for everyday commute. The trust is so strong that almost every brand has miserably failed in front of them when we talk about 100-110cc bikes. Even their 125cc Glamour lock horns with segment leader Honda Shine in tightest possible manner. Difference in sales of both the bikes is sometimes in just few hundred units. Apart from Honda, Hero MotoCorp rivals TVS and Bajaj Auto in India. Popularity of Hero commuter products have forced brands like Yamaha and Suzuki to launch volume generating products. However, they count a minimal percentage of that huge grand total. As the venture ended, Hero was allowed to use personally selected vendors and export to markets like South America and Africa. This helped them establish a global image and acquiring EBR further pushed performance to their roots. Still, the brand is stuck with that commuter tag above all, which they are ready to break with products like Xtreme 200R and XPulse 200. They have the largest dealership network among other manufacturers of India. "

Those who have read about Mr Soichiro Honda may know how one man never gave up his love for automobiles and made an empire as huge as present day Honda. From race engine tuning, contract failures with Toyota to US B-29 bomber attack on his factory, he still never thought about giving up and started working independently with 12 employees in a 170 sq ft shack. Honda started fitting bicycles with 50cc war surplus engines and later when the supply ended, built the replica and continued supplying them to bicycle owners. He soon liquidated everything he had for Honda Motor Company and partnered Takeo Fujisawa to form the first ever independent Honda motorcycle named Dream or D-Type in 1949. It took them just 15 years to take home the title of World’s largest motorcycle manufacturer. Their first car was chain-driven, rear wheel drive S500. Honda’s senior management has changed after the demise of Soichiro Honda and thus, their working style has also changed a lot under their new CEO. Honda took over many brands in last few decades. The Indian arm named Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) is responsible for their operations here. Honda first entered India through a partnership with Hero and they soon became the most selling brand here. After their official breakup, Hero and Honda became two exclusive brands, both selling more two wheelers than all others summed up in the Indian market. Majority of Honda’s revenue comes from North America as they have the largest selling car and motorcycle base in that continent. Takahiro Hachigo is their present CEO and plans of expansion never stop at Honda. Honda India is the leading scooter brand here as they almost cover 60% of the market with their 110cc and 125cc options. "

Presently, they operate under the leadership of KTM that indirectly makes them a close brand to Bajaj Auto of India. Operating headquarters are situated in Austria while manufacturing of products vary from market to market. They will soon follow the KTM path and all small capacity bikes will be manufactured in India. In 1903, they imported the first engine and came forward with their first Husky. From 1918, all components of the motorcycle was manufactured by Husqvarna itself. Two years later, they inaugurated their first engine factory. This helped them come up with a 550cc, four-stroke V-Twin that helped them compete with American brands like Indian and Harley Davidson. As they had already entered performance racing and endurance events, developing new products helped Husqvarna gain presence among their rivals. 1960s saw their lightweight two stroke off-road bikes gain traction as they continued winning global titles during next full decade in 125cc, 250cc and 500cc engine segments. They even tried their luck and hard work in car industry as second world war gave them unending opportunities. Still, the project was scrapped within 2 years due to feasibility studies. It was first sold to Cagiva in 1987 and then moved away with BMW from 2007. After trying their luck with this brand, BMW sold the complete brand to KTM. Their plan of getting a ‘Mini’ like response failed during these years. Moving into KTM helped them with certain aspects of production. Bigger displacement models kept the brand running like before while introduction of new 401 series with KTM engines was the biggest boost for Husqvarna. Sharing parts helped them keep the cost low and thus, sales will go up considerably after their plan of exploring markets goes into full swing. "

They are known for their chemical, mechanical and construction industry expertise while significant share can also be found in the IT industry. Their first step was assembly of Suzuki sourced designs under their own branding in South Korea. The parent brand has sold this division multiple times and therefore, ownership credentials have changed once in 2007 and then in 2014. Hyosung was once an effective brand among limited number of Indian superbikes of last decade. Comet was the most popular model listed under Hyosung international lineup. It comes in both superbike and sportbike variants and offers engines varying between 125cc and 650cc. Indian market once had a long list of products from Hyosung while they have reduced the number significantly because of declining sales and popularity. Their partnership with DSK didn’t work as expected as most promotional events from DSK are directed to the Benelli brand in India. Hyosung has showcased and even launched (internationally) a new generation of single cylinder products. Unfortunately, Indian market got some existing bikes discontinued and never got any of the new ones. Hyosung GT650R is a full faired superbike with 647cc, water cooled engine. It is good for 72.68 BHP at 9000 rpm and 60.9 Nm at 7500 rpm. The values are not bad at all but limited reach of their dealerships never helped it get the deserving sales. Also, design language of GT650R is decade old and still, it commands an equally huge price tag as extraordinary products like Ninja 650.It weighs 215 kg and thus, packs a lot extra weight than popular segment rivals. The same design can also be bought with GT250R. "

Until 1953, the name ‘Indian’ was only associated with bicycles and not with motorcycles. Within their first decade of origin, Indian Motorcycles became the highest selling brand of that time. The model names like Scout and Chief were more popular at that time. After 1953, the brand went bankrupt and production was ceased for all locations. From manufacturing cycles in 1897, the brand entered motorcycle production with lightweight options that looked more like bicycles. Around 1920, a proper motorcycle design could be seen within an Indian motorcycle. The brand diversified around 1940 as apart from motorcycles, they were seen making aircraft engines, air conditioner and boat engines. Bicycles were always on the cards. The war time demands emptied their inventory and thus, Harley Davidson won with better sales soon after the war was over. The present generation Indian Scout can be seen somewhere in the 1920 Scout as both shared the long fuel tank design that survived almost a century in the automotive market. They went into many deals and thus, the acquired products were rebranded as Indian motorcycles for more success by the owners. The brand had a serious rebirth when Polaris bought it in 2013. They now manufacture 10 models that mostly share parts with each other. The huge Thunderstroke 111 engine is tuned to produce maximum torque at lowest possible rpm’s, making it easier for the riders to carry their weight and luggage across all terrains. This engine is extremely powerful as dry weight for most bikes that it powers is over 300kg. Top spec bikes from Indian Motorcycles offer inbuilt navigation system, premium speakers for music and electronic safety features. The range is presently more effective against Harley Davidson as prices for India reveal a different story for both the American brands. "

MV Agusta first started with cafe racer style 125cc motorcycles and moved slowly into a bigger 250cc segment. For almost two decades, they worked on maximum displacement of 350cc for bike engines. As demand for bigger engines went up, MV Agusta later entered the four cylinder 600cc and then 750cc segment. It was necessary to save the brand from extinction. Vincenzo and Domenico Agusta started MV Agusta to save jobs of a large number of employees as demand for military equipment was over. The first generation bikes were produced in a bigger number while increasing engine size limited their sales number by passing years. However, the profifts were kept good enough in both cases. Until 1952, the bikes manufactured came with older parts. After this year, MV Agusta started using telescopic forks, full sized brake hubs and slimmer fuel tank. This helped them win their first title of 1952 Isle of Man TT with Cecil Sandford as the rider. The brand saw a large number of owners in last few decades as financial problems forced many big brands to sell MV Agusta. Last investment was seen from Mercedes AMG group in the form of 25% stake but still, the brand is expected to be under $50 million of debt. In India, MV Agusta has partnered with Kinetic group to retail three different models with multiple variants. This includes the popular F4, F3 and Brutale range. The most expensive model on offer is F4 RC while buyers with lesser power needs can go for F3 800 RC in India. "

They made almost 1 lakh Model 16H and Big 4 motorcycles for the second world war. Shareholder of Norton almost left the brand alone around mid 1950s and Associated Motorcycles bought all of them to acquire a majority stake in Norton. Even during the recession years, Norton was selling in good numbers and suffered no major loss. British market got the new 750cc Commando in 1968 with rubber insulations. It was the best machine that one could buy that year. They offered an electric starter in 1975 while bigger 850cc Commando was available two years before this tech. As BSA-Triumph was facing management problems, Norton entered the game and led a successful journey for next few years. Soon, everything came to an end and once shining brand went into hibernation. Norton motorcycles was brought to life in 2008 and then came the best ever 961cc, Norton Commando. Norton has planned an Indian entry but as their bikes are handbuilt, they will cost a lot more than standard bikes of this segment. Also, brining all these through CBU route will increase the pricing by a large margin. The bikes built by Norton around 1940s looked almost similar to Harley, Indian and Royal Enfield bikes of that time. Designing was not a major part as most products were used for war related works and thus, rigidity played an important role. They were issued licenses to manufacture a limited number of products during that era. Currently, production is based on demand of Norton products in their respective markets. "

Not just that, they have a dedicated commercial vehicle arm that manufactures products according to various market needs. The brand never started as a two wheeled motor vehicle unit as early history of Piaggio explains how efficiently they made military vehicles, public sector products like buses and trains, aluminum fittings, motorboats and aeronautical sector machines. They were specialized in aircraft engines, trucks and every kind of warfare related technology. The idea of Vespa came when Enrico Piaggio felt that people of Italy need some help with personal transportation medium. He completely left all these things behind and asked his designers to come up with something that could help solve the purpose. As motorcycles of that era were not as refined and clean as present generation products, the designer went on to bring Vespa design to life through his sketches. They even tried making changes to their existing military product lineup for a civil use one but never succeeded in that. The scooter was an instant hit as it came to be the cleanest possible option when traveling on rough roads. The scooter design saved the passenger from all road conditions. Piaggio came to India through three wheeler manufacturing unit but soon, the desire to retail scooters gave them a special place among other brands. They have acquired a large number of brands named Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, Moto Morini and more. All of them retail in India through Motoplex dealerships. These highly crafted showrooms carry the same theme worldwide and offers the best possible superbike ownership experience from Piaggio. They have raised concerns for various causes through their special edition models. The Italian brand offers aluminum chassis for all its scooters and offers multiple engine options for different users. "

First Royal Enfield was built in 1901 by Enfield Cycle Company Limited. The design of Royal Enfield bikes of 2018 have strong resemblance to products that were sold almost 6-7 decades back. Royal Enfield Bullet holds the title of longest surviving motorcycle design. The company had worked close to Royal Small Arms Factory as they supplied precision parts for guns. Enfield Motor Company started a separate motorcycle and car division during that phase. Today, the brand is one among top profitable two wheeler brands around the world. They were once in talks to buy Ducati when Volkswagen was preparing to sell the Italian superbike brand to compensate for the losses through dieselgate scandal. Royal Enfield Classic 350 is their most selling present day model that carries the same frame as Bullet series of motorcycles in India. The addition of modern features like disc brakes and electric starter helped them fetch more buyers with additional comfort and safety demands. Enfield of India actually started in 1955 by importing parts and assembling them in Chennai. Just two years later, they imported the machines that helped them with local production and thus, number of bikes sold increased with passing years. Enfield Cycle Company, the parent brand from which RE originated, was approached by British army to manufacture military grade products for Second World War. These bikes were excellent for all terrain riding and some were even designed to be dropped by a parachute. During this era, the factory was built underground to stay safe from surface level bombing. The present generation engines are a derivative of older RE products and they still offer unmatchable power and reliability. "

Modern day Suzuki products are distinguished with their unique design language that concentrates on single headlight design for even top spec products like GSX-R1000 and Hayabusa. Suzuki Intruder is a dedicated cruiser series that carries multiple engine sizes ranging from 150cc to 1800cc. They plan to take on a target of 1 million unit in sales before 2020 and bring more products to the Indian lineup. "

They initially selected White and Red as their only paint scheme. SWM started using other colors after 1979 as bikes that came later used blue frames, yellow/black paint finish and much more than before. They started using alloy swingarms from 1983 while new frame came into action an year later. Even after brining the required changes, the brand went under liquidation and soon, production was ceased. Twenty years after the brand was ended for once, Ampelio Macchi helped SWM with six newly designed products as Shineray group of China funded the brand to get back on the track. It will share some of the engines with Husqvarna in the beginning. Indian plans of SWM are pretty clear as they will place their products at competitive pricing for more sales. The classic series of bikes will carry medium displacement, single cylinder 445cc engine producing 29.5 HP at 7000 rpm and 33 Nm at 5500 rpm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. It may not be the most powerful option here but exclusive designing will help them get the best out of these products. Adventure series of products will use a bigger 600cc engine producing 57 HP of max torque. This could act as the most impressively placed off-roader of all time. "
