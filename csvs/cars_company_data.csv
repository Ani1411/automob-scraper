The company’s original production run took place from 1958 to 1986, during which they produced some excellent cars like the 240Z, 510 sedans. However, the actual origins of the company date back much further. The original cars were produced by the Kaishinsha Motorcar company and were named the DAT after the first letters in the names of the founders. Since there was minimal demand for cars in Japan at that time, the company mostly produced trucks for the Japanese military. It merged with Jitsuyo Jidosha and became DAT automobile manufacturing limited and then began selling three-wheeled and four-wheeled automobiles. In 1930, the Japanese government introduced a rule that allowed cars of 500cc and below to be driven without a license and so DAT automobiles began producing a line of 495cc engined cars to comply with these rules and named then Datsun (son of DAT). By the late 1950s Datsun began to eye America as a big market and under its parent company, Nissan made a name for itself over the next 25 years by producing a variety of vehicles. By 1986, Nissan wanted to promote its brand name in a stronger way and slowly decided to phase out the Datsun name in order to achieve the former. Current day As we had said earlier, the brand was revived in 2012 and the first car was launched in early 2014 for the Indian market. The current Datsun brand has a two-car line-up and in the coming future will be joined by the two more models. Each car in the line-up has been designed with a specific market in mind and has been tailor-made to suit the needs of just that market. The first car was the Datsun GO hatchback which has been designed keeping the Indian market in mind. It will soon be joined by the GO+ MPV, the Redi-GO compact hatchback and a sedan model that has been designed keeping the Russian market in mind. While each car has been designed with the needs of a specific market, we expect that Datsun will sell all the models in all its markets. The cars are being sold through Nissan dealerships and this will continue to be the case for another three years at least. The company only sells petrol-engined models but we expect that they will also offer diesel engined cars in the future. Datsun offers 3 new car models in India. Redi GO, GO and GO Plus are among the popular cars from Datsun. Datsun Redi GO is the lowest priced model at Rs. 2.49 lakh and Datsun GO Plus is the highest priced model at Rs. 3.84 lakh. "
